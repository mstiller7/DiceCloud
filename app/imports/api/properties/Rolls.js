 * Regular rolls:
 * The target number is computed in the target's context
 * The roll is computed in the action taker's context
 * If the roll meets or exceeds the target number, the adjustments and buffs
 * are applied
 *
 * Saving throws:
 * The target number is computed in the action taker's context
 * The roll is computed in the target's context
 * If the roll fails to meet or exceed the target number, the adjustments and
 *  child rolls are applied
